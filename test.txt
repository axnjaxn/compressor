This is a test file. I don't know how well it will compress, but a guy can hope, right?

I'm going to continue typing text and see how well it will all compress.

I met a traveller from an antique land
who said: two vast and trunkless legs of stone 
stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,
half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown
and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
tell that its sculptor well those passions read
which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things:
the hand that mocked them and the heart that fed,
and on the pedestal these words appear:
My name is Ozymandias, king of kings,
look on my works, ye mighty, and despair! Nothing beside remains.
Round the decay of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
The lone and level sands stretch far away.

I can't remember if those are the line breaks. Oh well.
